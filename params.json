{"name":"Now Hiring: Zookeepers","tagline":"Repository for my March One Game a Month and 7DRL entry","body":"Welcome to the git repository for my March One Game A Month and 7DRL entry titled \"Now Hiring: Zookeepers\". This game is a very simple roguelike, featuring a zookeeper who must capture as many animals as he can out in the savanna. The game is inspired by \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"The Binding of Isaac\" and \"Zaga-33\". All of these games are better games, go play them instead :)\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to use the code as you wish. If you do use any of the other assets please give credit where credit is due.
